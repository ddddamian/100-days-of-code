### Day 1: January 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Officially started 100 days of code. Did "Team Stats" freeform project from CODECADEMY. Added comments to "Meal Maker" project.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed doing the "Team Stats" project which allowed me to practice defining objects in JavaScript.

**Today's Progress**: Did a CODECADEMY lesson on JS classes. Started reading 'The PHOENIX PROJECT'. Read Chapter 1.

**Thoughts**: Made good progress on classes. The book seems like a good insight into working in the world of IT. So far, so good.
